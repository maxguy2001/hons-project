This section contains old solvers, readers, etc. which are still useful and may still be used under ceratin conditions but which are no longer used in the main run.
This includes:
- primal_simplex: A regular primal simplex solver with no modifications to it. It is a useful halfway point for understanding how to solve linear feasibility problems in code but does not solve the testcases we have been given due to degeneracy and the lack of a definitely positive valued basis (and hence no guaranteed basic feasible solution with an all-slack basis).
- primal_reader: An old reader for the primal simplex method. It is much slower than the final version
- presolve_reader: An old reader for presolve problems. It is approximately the same speed as the final reader but does not deliver the problems in the desired format.
